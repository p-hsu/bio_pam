    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    
        <p>Hey y'all! My name is Pamela Hsu but feel free to call me Pam. I'm currently working as a veterinary technician here in St. Louis but I am originally from Maryland. I live with my partner along with one cat, one snake, and one roommate (also a very good friend).</p>

        <p>I have been considering a career change recently and settled on this programming bootcamp with minor convincing from my partner. Between old injuries and being in the veterinary field for the past 10+ years, the "vet tech life" is becoming harder to maintain physically, mentally, and financially. This pandemic has also revealed the rational and accessibility for virtual work, making the IT field even more competitive and available. I've got extremely minor experience with html and css but in general I would consider myself completely new at programming. So far it's been quite interesting and fun, and I'm looking forward to learning even more.</p>
    
    <h2>My work-life balance:</h2>

        <p> One of the most important concepts that I hope a career change will allow me to practice better is, "work to live, not live to work". These are some of the activities that keep me sane:</p>
        <ol>
             <li>Rock climbing:</li>
                <p>I started rock climbing back in 2013 when I needed an escape from work. It turned out that rock climbing provided the perfect opportunity to help with my mental and physical health. I climb alot in a gym but have also been to Zion National Park, Moab, New River Gorge, Seneca Valley, and numerous places in Maryland to climb outdoors. Since the pandemic, I've not climbed either indoors or outdoors but hopefully I can get back to it soon.</p>
